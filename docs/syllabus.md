## Importance of Group Work and Participation Policy

Group work is a vital component of this course, reflecting the collaborative nature of real-world projects. Working effectively in a team is essential for your professional development. It’s important to approach group tasks with respect for each other’s ideas and perspectives, and to ensure that everyone contributes equitably.

Your team's performance in the course project plays a large part in your individual mark. In addition, in your individual mark the peer component relates to your contributions and participation in your team. 

To maintain fairness and academic integrity, all group members are expected to contribute equally to the project. Here’s how we handle group participation:

1.	**Peer Resolution**: When non-participation issues arise, the first step is for group members to address and attempt to resolve them internally. It’s important to document these efforts—such as meeting notes, emails, or messages on platforms like Slack or Discord—in case further action is required.
2.	**Reporting Non-Participation**: If internal resolution efforts do not succeed, the concerned student(s) should schedule a meeting with their TA. However, it’s important to note that without sufficient evidence of attempts at peer resolution, the TA will not proceed with scheduling the meeting. During the meeting, if scheduled, students should present the documented evidence and discuss possible next steps with the TA.
3.	**TA Intervention**: Following the consultation, the TA may involve other teaching team members to ensure that the workload is fairly distributed and completed by all group members. If additional actions are needed, the teaching team will directly engage with the specific group or individual members to determine the best course of action.

Non-contribution or “free riding” is not acceptable in this course. Every student is expected to contribute meaningfully to group projects. **Repeated failure to participate will result in penalties.** 


## Academic Expectations

In addition to all university rules, regulations, and academic guidelines, the following policies will hold in CPSC 100:

- Attendance and **prompt arrival** is expected at all classes and labs. In addition, there will be participation marks for in-class and lab activities.
- There will be no makeup for the midterm. Students who miss the midterm will receive a grade of zero.

## Course Communication Conventions

- For anything relevant to the larger group (conceptual questions, logistics issue, etc.): Post public-to-class on the course Piazza discussion group, which will be checked daily by course staff, and this way the whole class can benefit. 
- For personal logistics (project, assignments, etc.): Post to course staff on Piazza.
- For confidential or personal matters: Talk to or email the instructor(s). Include "[CPSC 100]" in the subject line of any email for a faster response. Emails without this subject line may be missed.
  - Make sure to include your full name and student number in all correspondence.
  - It is recommended to use your UBC email address for all course-related communication to ensure that your message is not marked as spam.

## UBC and Course Policies

### Academic Integrity

Academic honesty is essential to the continued functioning of the University of British Columbia as an institution of higher learning and research. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. Breach of those expectations or failure to follow the appropriate policies, principles, rules, and guidelines of the University with respect to academic honesty may result in disciplinary action.”  

Students are expected to be familiar with and adhere to the [UBC Academic Integrity guidelines](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-support/academic-integrity-citations/).

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, can be found [here](https://academicintegrity.ubc.ca/).

*Failure to comply with any of these responsibilities, either knowingly or through negligence, will also be considered an act of plagiarism and subject to the same penalties.*

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) / ChatGPT Policy

The use of AI tools such as ChatGPT is permitted with specific guidelines (subject to audits). Please refer to the [AI Policy](ai-policy.md) for more information.

### Course Waitlist

- Course waitlists are being handled centrally by the Computer Science department. Go [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists) for more information. Students who attend workshops will be given waitlist priority.
- If you do not plan to take the course, please remove yourself from the lecture or waitlist, so others may get in.
- Emails to the instructor/TAs about waitlist position will not be answered.

### Late Deliverables

- Late assignments and pre-reading quizzes will receive no credit. 
- In the extraordinary circumstance (e.g., medical or family emergency) that you are prevented from completing and submitting components on time, or fully participating in your group's work, we may allow late turn-in. In this case, contact your TA or the course staff well in advance of the deadline (a usual expectation would be 24 hours). At the discretion of staff considering the circumstance, a penalty may still be imposed of a mark reduction of 0.98^(hours late).

### Remarking Policy

If you feel a course item has been incorrectly assessed you may request that the item be remarked. However, before making a remarking request, please complete the following steps:

1. Review the marking rubric and ensure you understand the marking scheme.
2. Review the marking comments and ensure you understand the feedback.
3. Schedule a meeting with the TA to discuss the feedback and marking.
4. If you still feel the marking is incorrect, you may request a re-marking.

#### Request a Remarking

Requests must include a written letter for the re-marking and be submitted to the course TA/instructor within 5 business days from receiving the mark or a deadline specified by the TA/instructor, whichever comes first. The request must be signed and submitted via email. 

Course grades are considered final on a rolling basis (e.g. as we progress through the semester). After the regrading request deadline (e.g., 5 business days or deadline set by TA/instructor), grades will be considered final and no further requests will be accepted. Students are encouraged to review their grades and ask questions within the specified time frame. Inquiries after the deadline will not be considered.

The re-marking request will be reviewed by the teaching team and if accepted, the item will be re-marked in its entirety by both the course instructor and the marking TA. This may result in a higher, unchanged, or lower mark overall which will be final.
